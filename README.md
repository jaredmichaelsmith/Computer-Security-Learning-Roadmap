# Computer-Security-Learning-Roadmap

> If you are a newcomer to the field of Computer Security, the first question you may have is "How should I learn about this?"

> This is a roadmap of the path of going from no experience in computer security to being well on your way to having a security engineer position at Google or Facebook or pentesting for a consulting firm.

The roadmap is broken down into the following categories of learning:

- Beginner (where you should start if you have no experience)
- Novice (6 months - 1 year of experience)
- Intermediate (1 - 3 years of experience)
- Advanced (3 - 10 years of experience)
- Expert (10+ years of experience)

The year marks above are rough guidelines and are not meant to be generalizations for everyone in the field.
